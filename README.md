This is an obviously fake Twitter Phishing website I made for a CTF a while back.
You must use basic OSINT and some intuition/analysis to capture the flag. 
NO CHEATING BY LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE SOURCE CODE. Open Index.html and go from there. 
Google and inspecting elements is encouraged. 
Have fun!!
